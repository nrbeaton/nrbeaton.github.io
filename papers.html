        <i> Enumerating five families of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences; and introducing the powered Catalan numbers</i><br />

        <span id="powered" style ="display: none">The first problem addressed by this article is the enumeration of some families of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences. We solve some enumerative conjectures left open by the foundational work on the topics by Corteel et al., some of these being also solved independently by Kim and Lin. The strength of our approach is its robustness: we enumerate four families $F_1\subset F_2 \subset F_3 \subset F_4$ of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences ordered by inclusion using the same approach. More precisely, we provide a generating tree (with associated succession rule) for each family $F_i$ which generalizes the one for the family $F_{i−1}$.<br /><br />

        The second topic of the paper is the enumeration of a fifth family $F_5$ of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences (containing $F_4$). This enumeration is also solved via a succession rule, which however does not generalize the one for $F_4$. The associated enumeration sequence, which we call of <i>powered Catalan numbers</i>, is quite intringuing, and further investigated. We provide two different succession rules for it, denoted $\Omega_{pCat}$ and $\Omega_{steady}$, and show that they define two types of families enumerated by powered Catalan numbers. Among such families, we introduce the <i>steady paths</i>, which are naturally associated with $\Omega_{steady}$. They allow to bridge the gap between the two types of families enumerated by powered Catalan numbers: indeed, we provide a size-preserving bijection between steady paths and valley-marked Dyck paths (which are naturally associated to $\Omega_{pCat}$). <br /><br />

        Along the way, we provide several nice connections to families of permutations defined by the avoidance of vincular patterns, and some enumerative conjectures.</span>

        <span id="quarterplane" style ="display: none">The set of random walks with different step sets (of short steps) in the quarter plane has provided a rich set of models that have profoundly different integrability properties. In particular, 23 of the 79 effectively different models can be shown to have generating functions that are algebraic or differentiably finite. Here we investigate how this integrability may change in those 23 models where in addition to length one also counts the number of sites of the walk touching either the horizontal and/or vertical boundaries of the quarter plane. This is equivalent to introducing interactions with those boundaries in a statistical mechanical context. We are able to solve for the generating function in a number of cases. For example, when counting the total number of boundary sites without differentiating whether they are horizontal or vertical, we can solve the generating function of a generalised Kreweras model. However, in many instances we are not able to solve as the kernel methodology seems to break down when including counts with the boundaries.</span>

        <span id="LRU" style="display: none">Hierarchical caching enables users to obtain content from one of (possibly) many caches between an edge router cache and an origin server, reducing latency/overall network traffic. This can be used in many network architectures, including P2P networks and Content Distribution Networks. Of particular interest are Information Centric Networks (ICNs), which decouple content identifiers from specific network hosts and explicitly consider <i>universal caching</i> (collaboration between network routers) as a desirable feature.<br /><br />

        Performance analysis of a large-scale network of caches requires accurate mathematical models for various caching replacement algorithms. There is no previous study that models LRU-$k$. This caching replacement algorithm is important since its principle is the basis of recent caching replacement algorithms such as $k$-LRU that outperform LRU in many situations. The main contribution in this paper is modelling LRU-2, using Che's approximation, as a specific case of LRU-$k$ for $k=2$. We also extend our model to a network of LRU-2 caches. The model is validated analytically and with simulation. The experiments show that the proposed model approximates the LRU-2 algorithm accurately. LRU-2 and 2-LRU are also compared analytically and with simulations as the second contribution.</span>

        <span id="slicings" style="display: none">We provide a new succession rule (i.e. generating tree) associated with Schr&ouml;der numbers,
          that interpolates between the known succession rules for Catalan and Baxter numbers. We define Schr&ouml;der and Baxter generalizations of parallelogram polyominoes, called <i>slicings,</i> which grow according to these succession rules. In passing, we also exhibit Schr&ouml;der subclasses of Baxter classes, namely a Schr&ouml;der subset of triples of non-intersecting lattice paths, a new Schr&ouml;der subset of Baxter permutations, and a new Schr&ouml;der subset of mosaic floorplans. Finally, we define two families of subclasses of Baxter slicings: the $m$-skinny slicings and the $m$-row-restricted slicings, for $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Using functional equations and the kernel method, their generating functions are computed in some special cases, and we present an underpinned conjecture that they are algebraic for any $m$.</span>

        <span id="nonlocal" style="display: none">Using a lattice model of polymers in a tube, we define one way to characterise different configurations of a given knot as either “local” or “non-local”, based on a standard approach for measuring the “size” of a knot within a knotted polymer chain. The method involves associating knot-types to subarcs of the chain, and then identifying a knotted subarc with minimal arclength; this arclength is then the knot-size. If the resulting knot-size is small relative to the whole length of the chain, then the knot is considered to be localised or “local”; otherwise, it is “non-local”. Using this definition, we establish that all but exponentially few sufficiently long self-avoiding polygons (closed chains) in a tubular sublattice of the simple cubic lattice are “non-locally” knotted. This is shown to also hold for the case when the same polygons are subject to an external tensile force, as well as in the extreme case when they are as compact as possible (no empty lattice sites). We also provide numerical evidence for small tube sizes that at equilibrium non-local knotting is more likely than local knotting, regardless of the strength of the stretching or compressing force. The relevance of these results to other models and recent experiments involving DNA knots is also discussed.</span>

        <span id="cpaps" style="display: none">We review and extend what is known about the generating functions for consecutive pattern avoiding permutations of length 4, 5 and beyond, and their asymptotic behaviour. There are respectively, seven length-4 and twenty-five length-5 consecutive-Wilf classes. D-finite differential equations are known for the reciprocal of the exponential generating functions for four of the length-4 and eight of the length-5 classes. We give the solutions of some of these ODEs. An unsolved functional equation is known for one more class of  length-4, length-5 and beyond. We give the solution of this functional equation, and use it to show that the solution is not D-finite.<br /><br />
        For three further length-5 c-Wilf classes we give recurrences for two and a differential-functional equation for a third. For a fourth class we find a new algebraic solution.<br /><br />
        We give a polynomial-time algorithm to generate the coefficients of the generating functions which is faster than existing algorithms, and use this to (a) calculate the asymptotics for all classes of length 4 and length 5 to significantly greater precision than previously, and (b) use these extended series to search, unsuccessfully, for D-finite solutions for the unsolved classes, leading us to conjecture that the solutions are not D-finite. We have also searched, unsuccessfully, for differentially algebraic solutions.</span>

Here we use weighted Dyck paths as a simple model of two-dimensional polymer adsorption, and study the behaviour of the partition function zeros, particularly in the thermodynamic limit. The exact solvability of the model allows for a precise calculation of the locus of the zeros and the way in which an edge-singularity on the positive real axis is formed.</span>

        <span id="staircase" style="display: none">We study several models of staircase polygons on the $45^\circ$ rotated square lattice, which interact with an impenetrable surface while also being pushed towards or pulled away from the surface by a force. The surface interaction is governed by a fugacity $a$ and the force by a fugacity $y$. Staircase polygons are simplifications of more general self-avoiding polygons, a well-studied model of interacting ring polymers. For this simplified case we are able to exactly determine the limiting free energy in the full $a$-$y$ plane, and demonstrate that staircase polygons exhibit four different phases, including a "mixed" adsorbed-ballistic phase.</span>

We obtain and prove the asymptotic form of the free energy in both limits $f\to\pm\infty$. We conjecture that the $f\to-\infty$ asymptote is the same as the limiting free energy of "Hamiltonian" polygons, polygons which visit every vertex in a $L\times M\times N$ box.

        <span id="compressed" style="display: none">We study various self-avoiding walks (SAWs) which are constrained to lie in the upper half-plane and are subjected to a compressive force. This force is applied to the vertex or vertices of the walk located at the maximum distance above the boundary of the half-space. In the case of bridges, this is the unique end-point. In the case of SAWs or self-avoiding polygons, this corresponds to all vertices of maximal height. We first use the conjectured relation with the Schramm-Loewner evolution to predict the form of the partition function including the values of the exponents, and then we use series analysis to test these predictions.</span>

We introduce a new model of adsorbing prudent walks on the square lattice, which start on an impenetrable surface and accrue a fugacity $a$ with each step along the surface. These are different to other exactly solved models of polymer adsorption, like Dyck paths, Motzkin paths and partially-directed walks, in that they are not trivially directed - they are able to step in all lattice directions. We calculate the generating functions, free energies and surface densities for this model and observe a first-order adsorption transition at the critical value of the surface interaction.</span>

        <span id="pulling" style="display: none">Self-avoiding walks are a simple and well-known model of long, flexible polymers in a good solvent. Polymers being pulled away from a surface by an external agent can be modelled with self-avoiding walks in a half-space, with a Boltzmann weight $y = e^f$ associated with the pulling force. This model is known to have a critical point at a certain value $y_c$ of this Boltzmann weight, which is the location of a transition between the so-called free and ballistic phases. The value $y_c=1$ has been conjectured by several authors using numerical estimates. We provide a relatively simple proof of this result, and show that further properties of the free energy of this system can be determined by re-interpreting existing results about the two-point function of self-avoiding walks.</span>

Their definition is inspired by two previously-considered classes of self-avoiding walks, and can be viewed as a combination of those two models. We consider several methods for recursively generating these objects, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, and use these methods to solve the generating function, obtain very long series, and randomly generate walks of arbitrary size. We find that the growth constant of these walks is approximately 2.58, which is larger than that of any previously-solved class of self-avoiding walks.</span>

        <span id="honeycomb1" style="display: none">In 2010, Duminil-Copin and Smirnov proved a long-standing conjecture of Nienhuis, made in 1982, that the growth constant of self-avoiding walks on the hexagonal (a.k.a. honeycomb) lattice is $\mu = \sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}$. A key identity used in that proof was later generalised by Smirnov so as to apply to a general $O(n)$ loop model with $n\in[−2,2]$ (the case $n=0$ corresponding to self-avoiding walks).<br /><br />
          We modify this model by restricting to a half-plane and introducing a surface fugacity y associated with boundary sites (also called surface sites), and obtain a generalisation of Smirnov’s identity. The critical value of the surface fugacity was conjectured by Batchelor and Yung in 1995 to be $y_c=1+2/\sqrt{2-n}$. This value plays a crucial role in our generalized identity, just as the value of the growth constant did in Smirnov’s identity.<br /><br />
          For the case $n=0$, corresponding to self-avoiding walks interacting with a surface, we prove the conjectured value of the critical surface fugacity. A crucial part of the proof involves demonstrating that the generating function of self-avoiding bridges of height $T$, taken at its critical point $1/\mu$, tends to 0 as $T$ increases, as predicted from SLE theory.</span>

          <span id="honeycomb2" style="display: none">In a recent paper by Beaton et al, it was proved that a model of self-avoiding walks on the honeycomb lattice, interacting with an impenetrable surface, undergoes an adsorption phase transition when the surface fugacity is $1+\sqrt{2}$. Their proof used a generalization of an identity obtained by Duminil-Copin and Smirnov, and confirmed a conjecture of Batchelor and Yung. We consider a similar model of self-avoiding walk adsorption on the honeycomb lattice, but with the lattice rotated by $\pi/2$. For this model there also exists a conjecture for the critical surface fugacity, made in 1998 by Batchelor, Bennett-Wood and Owczarek. Using similar methods to Beaton et al, we prove that this is indeed the critical fugacity.<br /></span>

          <span id="honeycomb3" style="display: none">In a recent paper with Bousquet-Mélou, de Gier, Duminil-Copin and Guttmann (2012), we proved that a model of self-avoiding walks on the honeycomb lattice, interacting with an impenetrable surface, undergoes an adsorption phase transition when the surface fugacity is $1+\sqrt{2}$. Our proof used a generalisation of an identity obtained by Duminil-Copin and Smirnov (2012), and confirmed a conjecture of Batchelor and Yung (1995). Here we consider a similar model of self-avoiding walk adsorption on the honeycomb lattice, but with the impenetrable surface placed at a right angle to the previous orientation. For this model there also exists a conjecture for the critical surface fugacity, made by Batchelor, Bennett-Wood and Owczarek (1998). We adapt the methods of the earlier paper to this setting in order to prove the critical surface fugacity, but have to deal with several subtle complications which arise. This article is an abbreviated version of a paper of the same title, currently being prepared for submission.</span>

          <span id="critfugacityestimates" style="display: none">Recently Beaton, de Gier and Guttmann proved a conjecture of Batchelor and Yung that the critical fugacity of self-avoiding walks (SAW) interacting with (alternate) sites on the surface of the honeycomb lattice is $1+\sqrt{2}$. A key identity used in that proof depends on the existence of a parafermionic observable for SAW interacting with a surface on the honeycomb lattice. Despite the absence of a corresponding observable for SAW on the square and triangular lattices, we show that in the limit of large lattices, some of the consequences observed for the honeycomb lattice persist irrespective of lattice. This permits the accurate estimation of the critical fugacity for the corresponding problem for the square and triangular lattices. We consider both edge and site weighting, and results of unprecedented precision are achieved. We also prove the corresponding result for the edge-weighted case for the honeycomb lattice.</span>

          <span id="critpointestimates" style="display: none">Recently, Duminil-Copin and Smirnov proved a long-standing conjecture of Nienhuis that the connective constant of self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on the honeycomb lattice is $\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}$. A key identity used in that proof depends on the existence of a parafermionic observable for SAWs on the honeycomb lattice. Despite the absence of a corresponding observable for SAWs on the square and triangular lattices, we show that in the limit of large lattices, some of the consequences observed on the honeycomb lattice persist on other lattices. This permits the accurate estimation, though not an exact evaluation, of certain critical amplitudes, as well as critical points, for these lattices. For the honeycomb lattice, an exact amplitude for loops is proved.</span>

          <span id="prudentpolygons1" style="display: none">Prudent walks are special self-avoiding walks that never take a step towards an already occupied site, and $k$-sided prudent walks (with $k=1,2,3,4$) are, in essence, only allowed to grow along $k$ directions. Prudent polygons are prudent walks that return to a point adjacent to their starting point. Prudent walks and polygons have recently been enumerated by length and perimeter by Bousquet-Mélou and Schwerdtfeger. We consider the enumeration of prudent polygons by area. For the 3-sided variety, we find that the generating function is expressed in terms of a $q$-hypergeometric function, with an accumulation of poles towards the dominant singularity. This expression reveals an unusual asymptotic structure of the number of polygons of area $n$, where the critical exponent is the transcendental number $\log_{2}3$ and the amplitude involves tiny oscillations. Based on numerical data, we also expect similar phenomena to occur for 4-sided polygons. The asymptotic methodology involves an original combination of Mellin transform techniques and singularity analysis, which is of potential interest in a number of other asymptotic enumeration problems.</span>

          <span id="prudentpolygons2" style="display: none">We have studied the area-generating function of prudent polygons on the square lattice. Exact solutions are obtained for the generating function of two-sided and three-sided prudent polygons, and a functional equation is found for four-sided prudent polygons. This is used to generate series coefficients in polynomial time, and these are analysed to determine the asymptotics numerically. A careful asymptotic analysis of the three-sided polygons produces a most surprising result. A transcendental critical exponent is found, and the leading amplitude is not quite a constant, but is a constant plus a small oscillatory component with an amplitude approximately $10^{−8}$ times that of the leading amplitude. This effect cannot be seen by any standard numerical analysis, but it may be present in other models. If so, it changes our whole view of the asymptotic behaviour of lattice models.</span>

          <span id="thesis" style="display: none">We consider the enumeration of self-avoiding walks and polygons on regular lattices. Such objects are connected with many other problems in combinatorics, as well as in fields as diverse as physics and chemistry. We examine the general models of walks and polygons and methods we can use to study them; subclasses whose properties enable a rather deeper analysis; and extensions of these models which allow us to model physical phenomena like polymer collapse and adsorption.<br /><br />
            While the general models of self-avoiding walks and polygons are certainly not considered to be ‘solved’, recently a great deal of progress has been made in developing new methods for studying these objects and proving rigorous results about their enumerative properties, particularly on the honeycomb lattice. We consider these recent results and show that in some cases they can be extended or generalised so as to enable further proofs, conjectures and estimates. In particular, we find that properties shared by all two-dimensional lattices allow us to develop new methods for estimating the growth constants and certain amplitudes for the square and triangular lattices.<br /><br />
            The subclasses of self-avoiding walks and polygons that we consider are typically defined by imposing restrictions on the way in which a walk or polygon can be constructed. Ideally the restrictions should be as weak as possible, so as to result in a model that closely resembles the unrestricted case, while still enabling some manner of simple recursive construction. These recursions can sometimes lead to solutions for generating functions or other quantities of interest. Some of the models we consider display quite unusual asymptotic properties despite the relatively simple restrictions which lead to their construction.<br /><br />
            We approach the modelling of polymer adsorption in several ways. Firstly, we adapt some of the new methods for studying self-avoiding walks on the honeycomb lattice to account for interactions with an impenetrable surface. In this way we are able to prove the exact value of the critical surface fugacity for adsorbing walks, confirming an existing conjecture. Then, we show that some key identities for the honeycomb lattice model lead to a new method for estimating the critical surface fugacities for adsorption models on the square and triangular lattices. Many of the estimates we obtain in this way are new; for the cases where previous estimates did already exist, our results are several orders of magnitude more precise. Finally, we define some new solvable models of polymer adsorption which generalise existing models, and find that some of these models exhibit interesting and unexpected critical behaviour.</span>
