        <i> On consecutive pattern-avoiding permutations of length 4, 5 and beyond</i><br />

        <span id="cpaps" style="display: none">We review and extend what is known about the generating functions for consecutive pattern avoiding permutations of length 4, 5 and beyond, and their asymptotic behaviour. There are respectively, seven length-4 and twenty-five length-5 consecutive-Wilf classes. D-finite differential equations are known for the reciprocal of the exponential generating functions for four of the length-4 and eight of the length-5 classes. We give the solutions of some of these ODEs. An unsolved functional equation is known for one more class of  length-4, length-5 and beyond. We give the solution of this functional equation, and use it to show that the solution is not D-finite.<br /><br />
        For three further length-5 c-Wilf classes we give recurrences for two and a differential-functional equation for a third. For a fourth class we find a new algebraic solution.<br /><br />
        We give a polynomial-time algorithm to generate the coefficients of the generating functions which is faster than existing algorithms, and use this to (a) calculate the asymptotics for all classes of length 4 and length 5 to significantly greater precision than previously, and (b) use these extended series to search, unsuccessfully, for D-finite solutions for the unsolved classes, leading us to conjecture that the solutions are not D-finite. We have also searched, unsuccessfully, for differentially algebraic solutions.</span>

        <span id="slicings" style="display: none">We provide a new succession rule (i.e. generating tree) associated with Schr&ouml;der numbers,
          that interpolates between the known succession rules for Catalan and Baxter numbers. We define Schr&ouml;der and Baxter generalizations of parallelogram polyominoes, called <i>slicings,</i> which grow according to these succession rules. In passing, we also exhibit Schr&ouml;der subclasses of Baxter classes, namely a Schr&ouml;der subset of triples of non-intersecting lattice paths, a new Schr&ouml;der subset of Baxter permutations, and a new Schr&ouml;der subset of mosaic floorplans. Finally, we define two families of subclasses of Baxter slicings: the $m$-skinny slicings and the $m$-row-restricted slicings, for $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Using functional equations and the kernel method, their generating functions are computed in some special cases, and we present an underpinned conjecture that they are algebraic for any $m$.</span>

These polygons are subjected to a force $f$, parallel to the infinite axis of the tube. When $f>0$ the force stretches the polygons, while when $f\lt0$ the force is compressive. We obtain and prove the asymptotic form of the free energy in both limits $f\to\pm\infty$. We conjecture that the $f\to-\infty$ asymptote is the same as the limiting free energy of "Hamiltonian" polygons, polygons which visit every vertex in a $L\times M\times N$ box.

        <span id="compressed" style="display: none">We study various self-avoiding walks (SAWs) which are constrained to lie in the upper half-plane and are subjected to a compressive force. This force is applied to the vertex or vertices of the walk located at the maximum distance above the boundary of the half-space. In the case of bridges, this is the unique end-point. In the case of SAWs or self-avoiding polygons, this corresponds to all vertices of maximal height. We first use the conjectured relation with the Schramm-Loewner evolution to predict the form of the partition function including the values of the exponents, and then we use series analysis to test these predictions.</span>

        <span id="pru_surface" style="display: none">Prudent walks are self-avoiding walks which cannot step towards an already occupied vertex. We introduce a new model of adsorbing prudent walks on the square lattice, which start on an impenetrable surface and accrue a fugacity $a$ with each step along the surface. These are different to other exactly solved models of polymer adsorption, like Dyck paths, Motzkin paths and partially-directed walks, in that they are not trivially directed - they are able to step in all lattice directions. We calculate the generating functions, free energies and surface densities for this model and observe a first-order adsorption transition at the critical value of the surface interaction.</span>

        <span id="pulling" style="display: none">Self-avoiding walks are a simple and well-known model of long, flexible polymers in a good solvent. Polymers being pulled away from a surface by an external agent can be modelled with self-avoiding walks in a half-space, with a Boltzmann weight $y = e^f$ associated with the pulling force. This model is known to have a critical point at a certain value $y_c$ of this Boltzmann weight, which is the location of a transition between the so-called free and ballistic phases. The value $y_c=1$ has been conjectured by several authors using numerical estimates. We provide a relatively simple proof of this result, and show that further properties of the free energy of this system can be determined by re-interpreting existing results about the two-point function of self-avoiding walks.</span>

        <span id="weaklyprudent" style="display: none">We define and enumerate a new class of self-avoiding walks on the square lattice, which we call <i>weakly prudent bridges</i>. Their definition is inspired by two previously-considered classes of self-avoiding walks, and can be viewed as a combination of those two models. We consider several methods for recursively generating these objects, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, and use these methods to solve the generating function, obtain very long series, and randomly generate walks of arbitrary size. We find that the growth constant of these walks is approximately 2.58, which is larger than that of any previously-solved class of self-avoiding walks.</span>

        <i>The critical fugacity for surface adsorption of self-avoiding walks on the honeycomb lattice is $1+\sqrt{2}$</i><br />

        <span id="honeycomb1" style="display: none">In 2010, Duminil-Copin and Smirnov proved a long-standing conjecture of Nienhuis, made in 1982, that the growth constant of self-avoiding walks on the hexagonal (a.k.a. honeycomb) lattice is $\mu = \sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}$. A key identity used in that proof was later generalised by Smirnov so as to apply to a general $O(n)$ loop model with $n\in[−2,2]$ (the case $n=0$ corresponding to self-avoiding walks).<br /><br />
          We modify this model by restricting to a half-plane and introducing a surface fugacity y associated with boundary sites (also called surface sites), and obtain a generalisation of Smirnov’s identity. The critical value of the surface fugacity was conjectured by Batchelor and Yung in 1995 to be $y_c=1+2/\sqrt{2-n}$. This value plays a crucial role in our generalized identity, just as the value of the growth constant did in Smirnov’s identity.<br /><br />
          For the case $n=0$, corresponding to self-avoiding walks interacting with a surface, we prove the conjectured value of the critical surface fugacity. A crucial part of the proof involves demonstrating that the generating function of self-avoiding bridges of height $T$, taken at its critical point $1/\mu$, tends to 0 as $T$ increases, as predicted from SLE theory.</span>

We consider a similar model of self-avoiding walk adsorption on the honeycomb lattice, but with the lattice rotated by $\pi/2$. For this model there also exists a conjecture for the critical surface fugacity, made in 1998 by Batchelor, Bennett-Wood and Owczarek. Using similar methods to Beaton et al, we prove that this is indeed the critical fugacity.<br /></span>

Our proof used a generalisation of an identity obtained by Duminil-Copin and Smirnov (2012), and confirmed a conjecture of Batchelor and Yung (1995). Here we consider a similar model of self-avoiding walk adsorption on the honeycomb lattice, but with the impenetrable surface placed at a right angle to the previous orientation. For this model there also exists a conjecture for the critical surface fugacity, made by Batchelor, Bennett-Wood and Owczarek (1998). We adapt the methods of the earlier paper to this setting in order to prove the critical surface fugacity, but have to deal with several subtle complications which arise.

A key identity used in that proof depends on the existence of a parafermionic observable for SAW interacting with a surface on the honeycomb lattice. Despite the absence of a corresponding observable for SAW on the square and triangular lattices, we show that in the limit of large lattices, some of the consequences observed for the honeycomb lattice persist irrespective of lattice. This permits the accurate estimation of the critical fugacity for the corresponding problem for the square and triangular lattices. We consider both edge and site weighting, and results of unprecedented precision are achieved. We also prove the corresponding result for the edge-weighted case for the honeycomb lattice.</span>

          <span id="prudentpolygons1" style="display: none">Prudent walks are special self-avoiding walks that never take a step towards an already occupied site, and $k$-sided prudent walks (with $k=1,2,3,4$) are, in essence, only allowed to grow along $k$ directions. Prudent polygons are prudent walks that return to a point adjacent to their starting point. Prudent walks and polygons have recently been enumerated by length and perimeter by Bousquet-Mélou and Schwerdtfeger. We consider the enumeration of prudent polygons by area. For the 3-sided variety, we find that the generating function is expressed in terms of a $q$-hypergeometric function, with an accumulation of poles towards the dominant singularity. This expression reveals an unusual asymptotic structure of the number of polygons of area $n$, where the critical exponent is the transcendental number $\log_{2}3$ and the amplitude involves tiny oscillations. Based on numerical data, we also expect similar phenomena to occur for 4-sided polygons. The asymptotic methodology involves an original combination of Mellin transform techniques and singularity analysis, which is of potential interest in a number of other asymptotic enumeration problems.</span>

          <span id="prudentpolygons2" style="display: none">We have studied the area-generating function of prudent polygons on the square lattice. Exact solutions are obtained for the generating function of two-sided and three-sided prudent polygons, and a functional equation is found for four-sided prudent polygons. This is used to generate series coefficients in polynomial time, and these are analysed to determine the asymptotics numerically. A careful asymptotic analysis of the three-sided polygons produces a most surprising result. A transcendental critical exponent is found, and the leading amplitude is not quite a constant, but is a constant plus a small oscillatory component with an amplitude approximately $10^{−8}$ times that of the leading amplitude. This effect cannot be seen by any standard numerical analysis, but it may be present in other models. If so, it changes our whole view of the asymptotic behaviour of lattice models.</span>

          <span id="thesis" style="display: none">We consider the enumeration of self-avoiding walks and polygons on regular lattices. Such objects are connected with many other problems in combinatorics, as well as in fields as diverse as physics and chemistry. We examine the general models of walks and polygons and methods we can use to study them; subclasses whose properties enable a rather deeper analysis; and extensions of these models which allow us to model physical phenomena like polymer collapse and adsorption.<br /><br />
            While the general models of self-avoiding walks and polygons are certainly not considered to be ‘solved’, recently a great deal of progress has been made in developing new methods for studying these objects and proving rigorous results about their enumerative properties, particularly on the honeycomb lattice. We consider these recent results and show that in some cases they can be extended or generalised so as to enable further proofs, conjectures and estimates. In particular, we find that properties shared by all two-dimensional lattices allow us to develop new methods for estimating the growth constants and certain amplitudes for the square and triangular lattices.<br /><br />
            The subclasses of self-avoiding walks and polygons that we consider are typically defined by imposing restrictions on the way in which a walk or polygon can be constructed. Ideally the restrictions should be as weak as possible, so as to result in a model that closely resembles the unrestricted case, while still enabling some manner of simple recursive construction. These recursions can sometimes lead to solutions for generating functions or other quantities of interest. Some of the models we consider display quite unusual asymptotic properties despite the relatively simple restrictions which lead to their construction.<br /><br />
            We approach the modelling of polymer adsorption in several ways. Firstly, we adapt some of the new methods for studying self-avoiding walks on the honeycomb lattice to account for interactions with an impenetrable surface. In this way we are able to prove the exact value of the critical surface fugacity for adsorbing walks, confirming an existing conjecture. Then, we show that some key identities for the honeycomb lattice model lead to a new method for estimating the critical surface fugacities for adsorption models on the square and triangular lattices. Many of the estimates we obtain in this way are new; for the cases where previous estimates did already exist, our results are several orders of magnitude more precise. Finally, we define some new solvable models of polymer adsorption which generalise existing models, and find that some of these models exhibit interesting and unexpected critical behaviour.</span>
